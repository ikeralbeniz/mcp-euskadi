# Open Data Euskadi MCP Server

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides information about the Basque Open Data system,  forked from [DNDzgz MCP Server](https://github.com/danilat/mcp-dndzgz) that provides information about the Zaragoza tram system, including real-time tram arrival estimations and station information using the [DNDzgz](https://www.dndzgz.com/) API.

Or configure in your MCP client, for example:
```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "euskadi": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": [
                "/Users/ikeralbeniz/workspace/mcp-euskadi/index.js"
            ],
